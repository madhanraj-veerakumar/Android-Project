Expense Tracker is an Android application designed to help users track their daily personal expenses. The app allows users to input the cost of each item they buy, categorize their expenses, and view a summary of their spending patterns over time. With a user-friendly interface and powerful features, the app helps users manage their finances more effectively.

The core objective of this application is to provide users with an intuitive tool for recording their expenses and visualizing their financial behavior. Whether you're tracking groceries, entertainment, or transportation costs, this app aims to streamline how you manage your finances.

### Key Features
